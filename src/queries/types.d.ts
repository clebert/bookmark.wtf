 * The encoded contents may be binary.
 *
 * For text files, no assumptions are made about the character encoding of
 * the file contents (after base64 decoding).  No charset transcoding or
 * line-ending normalization will be performed; it is the client's
 * responsibility to manage the character encoding of files they provide.
 * However, for maximum compatibility we recommend using UTF-8 encoding
 * and ensuring that all files in a repository use a consistent
 * line-ending convention (`\n` or `\r\n`), and that all files end
 * with a newline.
 *
 * ### Modeling file changes
 *
 * Each of the the five types of conceptual changes that can be made in a
 * git commit can be described using the `FileChanges` type as follows:
 *
 * 1. New file addition: create file `hello world\n` at path `docs/README.txt`:
 *
 *        {
 *          "additions" [
 *            {
 *              "path": "docs/README.txt",
 *              "contents": base64encode("hello world\n")
 *            }
 *          ]
 *        }
 *
 * 2. Existing file modification: change existing `docs/README.txt` to have new
 *    content `new content here\n`:
 *
 *        {
 *          "additions" [
 *            {
 *              "path": "docs/README.txt",
 *              "contents": base64encode("new content here\n")
 *            }
 *          ]
 *        }
 *
 * 3. Existing file deletion: remove existing file `docs/README.txt`.
 *    Note that the path is required to exist -- specifying a
 *    path that does not exist on the given branch will abort the
 *    commit and return an error.
 *
 *        {
 *          "deletions" [
 *            {
 *              "path": "docs/README.txt"
 *            }
 *          ]
 *        }
 *
 *
 * 4. File rename with no changes: rename `docs/README.txt` with
 *    previous content `hello world\n` to the same content at
 *    `newdocs/README.txt`:
 *
 *        {
 *          "deletions" [
 *            {
 *              "path": "docs/README.txt",
 *            }
 *          ],
 *          "additions" [
 *            {
 *              "path": "newdocs/README.txt",
 *              "contents": base64encode("hello world\n")
 *            }
 *          ]
 *        }
 *
 *
 * 5. File rename with changes: rename `docs/README.txt` with
 *    previous content `hello world\n` to a file at path
 *    `newdocs/README.txt` with content `new contents\n`:
 *
 *        {
 *          "deletions" [
 *            {
 *              "path": "docs/README.txt",
 *            }
 *          ],
 *          "additions" [
 *            {
 *              "path": "newdocs/README.txt",
 *              "contents": base64encode("new contents\n")
 *            }
 *          ]
 *        }

   * Appends a commit to the given branch as the authenticated user.
   *
   * This mutation creates a commit whose parent is the HEAD of the provided
   * branch and also updates that branch to point to the new commit.
   * It can be thought of as similar to `git commit`.
   *
   * ### Locating a Branch
   *
   * Commits are appended to a `branch` of type `Ref`.
   * This must refer to a git branch (i.e.  the fully qualified path must
   * begin with `refs/heads/`, although including this prefix is optional.
   *
   * Callers may specify the `branch` to commit to either by its global node
   * ID or by passing both of `repositoryNameWithOwner` and `refName`.  For
   * more details see the documentation for `CommittableBranch`.
   *
   * ### Describing Changes
   *
   * `fileChanges` are specified as a `FilesChanges` object describing
   * `FileAdditions` and `FileDeletions`.
   *
   * Please see the documentation for `FileChanges` for more information on
   * how to use this argument to describe any set of file changes.
   *
   * ### Authorship
   *
   * Similar to the web commit interface, this mutation does not support
   * specifying the author or committer of the commit and will not add
   * support for this in the future.
   *
   * A commit created by a successful execution of this mutation will be
   * authored by the owner of the credential which authenticates the API
   * request.  The committer will be identical to that of commits authored
   * using the web interface.
   *
   * If you need full control over author and committer information, please
   * use the Git Database REST API instead.
   *
   * ### Commit Signing
   *
   * Commits made using this mutation are automatically signed by GitHub if
   * supported and will be marked as verified in the user interface.
   *
