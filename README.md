# bookmark.wtf

A free and open-source bookmark manager that uses GitHub Gist as database.

## Getting started

To get started, all you need to do is create a free GitHub account and allow
[bookmark.wtf](https://bookmark.wtf) to access your gists. You can do both in one go by clicking on
the `"Sign in with GitHub"` button.

**Disclaimer:** I do not know your account, nor do I have access to your bookmark collections unless
you explicitly share them with me via link. This software is operated by me free of charge. You have
no claim on the availability of the service.

## Features

- Unlimited number of bookmark collections, 300 bookmarks per collection.
- **No vendor lock-in.** Bookmark collections are stored in
  [Markdown format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) as secret<sup>1</sup> GitHub gists.
- Bookmark collections are **shareable** via link and also **forkable** by others.
- Bookmarks are automatically sorted by click count.

_1 Secret gists aren't private. If you send the URL of a secret gist to a friend , they'll be able
to see it. However, if someone you don't know discovers the URL, they'll also be able to see your
gist._
