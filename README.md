# bookmark.wtf

A free and open-source bookmark manager that uses GitHub Gist as database.

## Getting started

To get started, all you need to do is create a free GitHub account and allow
[bookmark.wtf](https://bookmark.wtf) to access your gists. You can do both in
one go by clicking on the `"Sign in with GitHub"` button.

**Disclaimer:** I do not know your account, nor do I have access to your
bookmark collections unless you explicitly share them with me via link. This
software is operated by me free of charge. You have no claim on the availability
of the service.

## Features

- Unlimited number of bookmark collections, 300 bookmarks per collection.
- **No vendor lock-in.** Bookmark collections are stored in
  [Markdown format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) as GitHub Gists.
- Bookmark collections are **shareable** via link and also **forkable** by
  others.
- [Bookmarklet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmarklet) functionality for
  quickly adding new bookmarks.
- Full text search within bookmark collections.
- Bookmarks are automatically sorted by click count.
