# bookmark.wtf

An open source developed bookmark manager with GitHub Gist as data backend.

1. To use this application, you need to sign in to GitHub and give it permission
   to access your gists.
1. The application does not track you or store data outside your browser or
   GitHub. The source code of the application is publicly available.
1. Your bookmarks are stored in markdown format (human and machine readable) in
   GitHub Gist. This allows you to use them without this application.
1. You can manage as many gists and thus bookmark collections as you like.
1. By sharing the URL, other people can access your bookmark collections. Your
   bookmark collections, respectively your gists, are only "secret" as long as
   you do not share the URL with anyone.

**Disclaimer:** This application is developed by me in my spare time for free.
You have no claim to correct functioning or even availability. Please use this
application at your own risk. There is an explicit risk that due to software
bugs your data on GitHub Gist may be lost.

## Rationale

I implemented this application mainly as a basis for experimenting with software
architecture design patterns. The application offers a manageable but
sufficiently complex functional range and was implemented by me using
state-of-the-art technology.

At the same time, I wanted a simple bookmark manager for all devices and
browsers. Therefore, working on this project is a win-win situation for me.
